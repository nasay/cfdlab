# Free Surfaces with LBM D3Q19
Project for Computational Fluid Dynamics Lab course.

Group 6: Nathan Brei, Irving Cabrera, Natalia Saiapova.

## Compilation.

Requirements: UNIX based OS.

Use ```make``` command to compile:
```
>> make
```

There is debug mode available. This mode includes additional checks for velocity and density, computes total mass in the domain and checks that there is no FLUID cell that is neighboring with a GAS cell directly. Also it calculates a time spent on the following parts: streaming, collision, flag updating and boundary treatment. 
```
>> make debug
```
## Usage
To run the program use
```
>> ./lbsim <exampleName> <number of threads>
```
For each example it is required to have ```<exampleName>.dat``` and ```<exampleName>.pgm``` files. They have to be placed in the ```examples``` directory.
```<number of threads>``` specifies how many threads will be used by OpenMP.

Output is vtk-files and they can be found in the ```vtk-output``` directory (if thare is no such directory it will be created).

### Description of input files
We added a few new fields to the ```input.dat``` file:

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
|radius| Radius of a droplet|
|exchange_factor| Factor to increase speed of a mass exchnge (mainly to get more beautiful videos) |
|forces_x| Gravity force in the ```x``` direction |
|forces_y| Gravity force in the ```y``` direction |
|forces_z| Gravity force in the ```z``` direction |

## What we have done

####New cell types
First of all we added 2 new cell types: ```FLUID``` and ```INTERFACE```.
Here is table representing cell types, which should be used in ```<exampleName>.pgm``` file:

| Cell type | Value | Cell type | Value
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FLUID | 0 |PRESSURE_IN | 5 |
| INTERFACE | 1 |OBSTACLE | 6 |
| MOVING_WALL | 2 |FREESLIP | 7 |
| INFLOW | 3 |NOSLIP | 8 |
| OUTFLOW | 4 |GAS | 9 |

####Test functions
In the ```checks.c``` one can find three check functions:

1. ```check_in_rank``` checks that every ```FLUID``` cell has a density between ```0.9``` and ```1.1``` and norm of the velocity vector is less then ```sqrt(3) * C_S```;
2. ```check_flags``` checks that no ```FLUID``` cell has a ```GAS``` neighbor;
3. ```check_mass``` compute total mass in the domain (```FLUID``` and ```INTERFACE``` cells).

This checks will be activated in debug mode and be executed every time when we write output file.

####External forces influence
In collision step additional term for external forces was added. 
Related function in ```collision.c```: ```computeExternal(int i, float density, float * extForces)```, where ```extForces``` is a force vector specified in input file.

####Mass and fluid fraction fields
For every cell we store 2 additional float values: mass and fluid fraction. We update mass field during streaming step. Fluid fraction field is updated during collide step.
To be able get more fast we introduced ```exchange_factor``` in an input file. By this factor we increase mass exchange between cells.
####DF from gas cells
In the streaming step was added reconstruction from ```GAS``` cells. Streaming works normally for all ```FLUID``` cells amd for ```INTERFACE``` cells we are checking whether a neighbor is GAS. If yes, we are using outflow boundary formula in this direction.

####Flag update
From the mass fraction for each cell we determine whether that cell emptied or filled. We track these cells using two arrays, ```emptiedCells``` and ```filledCells```. We perform the filling and emptying in separate phases, ```performFill()``` and ```performEmpty()```. These phases are asymmetric in order to handle the case of a cell filling adjacent to a cell emptying. If this happens, the 'filling' operation cancels the neighbor's 'emptying' operation and the neighboring cell is stricken from ```emptiedCells```. 

Both phases maintain the loop invariant of a contiguous interface layer. When an ```INTERFACE``` cell is converted to ```FLUID```, all ```GAS``` neighbors are converted to ```INTERFACE```. Correspondingly, when an ```INTERFACE``` is converted to ```GAS```, all ```FLUID``` cells are converted to ```INTERFACE```. 


####Parallelization with OpenMP
We have added ```pragma omp parallel for``` to streaming, collision, treatment boundaries and update flags.

####Other optimizations
At the beginning our main bottleneck was ```computeFeq``` function which took approximately 42% percent of the whole time. We splitted the Q-loop in this function in a way that compiler was able to vectorize it, then we got rid of all divisions and replaced them by corresponding multiplications. Then we changed types of all double fields to float. It gave us aproximately 2x speedup.
